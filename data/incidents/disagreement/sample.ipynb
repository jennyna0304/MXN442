The test result showed that the sample contained sorbic acid at a level of 69 parts per million (ppm) and sulphur dioxide at a level of 41 ppm. Although the levels are within the legal limits, the functional class and names of the two additives were not declared on the food label of the sample. Sulphur dioxide is a commonly used preservative in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headaches and nausea after consumption. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularity. The distributor concerned has initiated a recall on the affected batch of the product according to the CFS's instructions. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. Advice to the Trade Stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it. Advice to Consumers Should not consume the affected batch of the product. Further Information The CFS press release Members of the public may call its hotline at 2291 6216 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

Results showed that it contained Dimethyl yellow, a non-permitted colouring matter in food under local legislation. Although there have been research results showing that Dimethyl yellow might cause cancer in animal studies, no sufficient evidence has been found to confirm the health effects on humans from dietary intake of this colouring matter. However, for the sake of prudence, the CFS urged consumers not to consume the batch of affected product. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety - The CFS has taken follow-up action including issuing warning to the retailer concerned, and instructed the traders concerned to take the affected product off the shelves. The distributor/importer are also required to stop selling the affected product. - The CFS will alert the trade and the Taiwan authority, continue to closely monitor the situation and take appropriate follow-up actions. Investigation is still ongoing. Advice to the Trade - Stop selling the affected product. Advice to Consumers - Not to consume the batch of affected product.
