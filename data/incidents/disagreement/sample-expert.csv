10;Undeclared allergen (sulphur dioxide and sorbic acid) found in prepackaged date sample Issue Date 5.1.2021 Source of Information Centre for Food Safety (CFS) Food Product Prepackaged date Product Name and Description Product name: (Not available in English) Place of origin: China Distributor: Premier Food Ltd Net weight: 450 grams per pack Best-before date: December 31, 2021 Reason For Issuing Alert Subsequent to announcing earlier that a prepackaged date sample taken from an online shop was detected with excessive preservative and in breach of the food labelling regulation, the CFS took another date sample from the same distributor from a shop in a shopping centre in West Kowloon for testing during follow-up investigations. The test result showed that the sample contained sorbic acid at a level of 69 parts per million (ppm) and sulphur dioxide at a level of 41 ppm. Although the levels are within the legal limits, the functional class and names of the two additives were not declared on the food label of the sample. Sulphur dioxide is a commonly used preservative in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products. Sulphur dioxide is water soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headaches and nausea after consumption. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety The CFS has informed the vendor concerned of the irregularity. The distributor concerned has initiated a recall on the affected batch of the product according to the CFS's instructions. The CFS will alert the trade, continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. Investigation is ongoing. Advice to the Trade Stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it. Advice to Consumers Should not consume the affected batch of the product.

18;"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Pacoima, CA (April 6, 2009) – Energy Club announced the voluntary recall of Energy Club and Mucho Sabor branded in-shell salted pistachios due to potential contamination with salmonella as a follow up to the voluntary recall of roasted shelled and inshell pistachios announced by Setton Pistachio of Terra Bella, Inc. on March 30, 2009.  Salmonella can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.

However, for the sake of prudence, the CFS urged consumers not to consume the batch of affected product. Action Taken by the Centre for Food Safety - The CFS has taken follow-up action including issuing warning to the retailer concerned, and instructed the traders concerned to take the affected product off the shelves. The distributor/importer are also required to stop selling the affected product. - The CFS will alert the trade and the Taiwan authority, continue to closely monitor the situation and take appropriate follow-up actions. Investigation is still ongoing. Advice to the Trade - Stop selling the affected product. Advice to Consumers - Not to consume the batch of affected product.

28;"King Soopers said today it has recalled its chicken salad sandwiches that are sold in King Soopers and City Market stores, located in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming. The product may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.
Listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
No confirmed reports of illness or injury have been reported to date.  Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.
The chicken salad sandwich is the prepackaged 6.8 oz item sold in the deli department at King Soopers.  King Soopers has removed this item from store shelves and initiated its customer recall notification system that alerts customers who may have purchased recalled products through register receipt tape messages and phone calls.  
King Soopers was notified on September 21st  by the manufacturer, Journey Cuisine, that the recalled product may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.  The company has ceased production and distribution of the product pending an investigation.
Customers who have purchased the product described above should not consume it and should return it to a store for a full refund or replacement.
